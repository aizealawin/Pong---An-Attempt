# Pong---An-Attempt

#### Making a Pong Game using only JS by Kusal Tholka Mudalige

#### [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/9ZgeP3Pe/pong-an-attempt) - Click me for live updates.

## **_Description_**

### Pong - the famous two player game where on a canvas a randomly pathing ball is hit back and forth. After every successful hit, the ball's speed will incrementally increase.

## **_Requirements_**

- Be a new repo. Create a new repo in your GitHub and build your project there. DO NOT name your repository Project 1. Give it a real name.

- Include a beautiful, professional README.md (use markdown)

- Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)

- Include a minimum of 2 HTML pages and navigation between them

- Include a minimum of 2 event handlers

- Have at least 20 meaningful git commits. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.

- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments, if in your code at all, should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.

- Display proper use of global variables and function parameters (function scopes)

- Use camelCase for JavaScript variables

- Be deployed on Surge (We will cover this on Monday of project week)

## **_Functionality_**

### There are a few things that will need to be present in a functional game of Pong. Here is a list of the things that I am looking to add:

### <u>**_The Game Pieces_** </u>

- A canvas including:
  - A pair of paddles
  - An animated auto-pathing ball
  - A division through the center
- A score board - tracking when ball is missed
- A reset button
- A pause button
- Dark mode - extra credit
- CPU functionality - if I have time.
- Collision physics

### <u>**_The Front End_**</u>

#### This is the least of my current worries.

- A bridged website from start page to game page
- CSS designing to make the site look pretty
- Use of grid / flexbox /table to align the content of the game page

## **_The Timeline_**

### Below is a list of how I intend on spending my time tackling and breaking down this project:

- Research Canvas Creation - Monday
- Implement a working canvas - Monday
- Research animation / random pathing
  -> potentially use x/y coords? - Tuesday
- Research collision properties - Tuesday
- Paddle functionality - Tuesday
- Core setup functionality, start, restart, pause, etc - Wednesday
- Score functionality - Wednesday
- Bug Testing - Wednesday / Thursday
- Moving on to CSS
- Make me pretty. - Thursday / Friday

## **Credits**

### Imagine having credits at this point hahahaha
